Hi, I'm smallketchup82. I like full-stack programming. Programming has been my hobby since I was young. I hope to make it a career somewhere down the line.

### Stuff I'm Good at
- TypeScript, Node.js, JavaScript (Usually what I program in)
- HTML & CSS
- Ubuntu & Arch Linux
- NGINX
- Docker

### Stuff I'm Okay at
- Python (I forgot a bit of it since I don't program in python often)
- SQL (I'm decent but could be better)
- Kubernetes (Requires a lot of commitment to learn, plus I lack the resources to make a makeshift cluster. Want to master nevertheless)

### Learning ATM
- C#

### What I Plan on Learning
- React/Vue (or other web frameworks)
- Express
- Electron
- PHP
