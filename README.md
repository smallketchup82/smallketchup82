Hi, I'm smallketchup82. I like full-stack programming. Programming has been my hobby since I was young.

### Some stuff im good at
- JavaScript & Node.js (Usually what I program in)
- HTML & CSS
- Ubuntu/Debian & Arch Linux
- NGINX
- Docker

### Some stuff im okay at
- Python (I forgot a bit of it since I don't program in python often)
- SQL (I'm decent at databases but could be better)
- Kubernetes (Requires a lot of commitment to learn, plus I lack the resources to make a makeshift cluster. Want to master nevertheless)

### Learning ATM
- C#

### What I plan on learning
- React/Vue (or other web frameworks)
- Maybe PHP
